# Question & Solution for Homework-2

1. Why is Client diversity important for Ethereum?

- More developers with different programming language skills get to participate and make robust clients.
- If there is a bug in one client, the block production wouldn't necessarily be halted.

2. Importance and explanation of concepts in order of importance from my perspective

- Security: Security means that I get to spend my assets and no bad actor gets to forge a transaction to defraud me. It is the consense that protects the network and makes it hard for bad actors to double spend or replay a transaction. Without adequate security, a blockchain is unusable.
- Finality: For conducting business on chain, it needs to be fast. Thus, finality of a transaction and assurance that confirmed transaction did get added to the chain is very important quality.
- TPS & transaction cost: TPS is the troughput of the chain, higher TPS means the capacity to serve more transactions and more people have access to conduct business on chain.
- Decentralisation: Decentralisation is a good quality, it means censorship is avoided and peers can work among themselves. Free market is secured and all participants have the assurance that no one entity controls the network creating assymetrical advantage.
- Privacy: Even tough I placed privacy last, it is important feature for finance, especially to secure business logic of companies and the protection to hide the suppliers they pay or the expenses they incur to run the business. For an individual it is as important, like for anonymous donation or personal purchases like medical supply or in general to feel safe and protected about privacy.
