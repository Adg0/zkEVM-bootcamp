# Polynomial practice

## Given $p(x) = x^3 - 5x^2 - 4x +20$

1. find the positive integer root, i.e $p(a) = 0$ (hint $a < 7$)
	- using group factoring method:

	$ x^2(x - 5) + -4(x - 5) $

	$ (x - 5)(x^2 - 4) $

	$ (x - 5)(x - 2)(x + 2) $

	- Thus positive integer roots for the given polynomial, are $(x - 5) = 0$ and $(x - 2) = 0$ which are `5` and `2`.

2. write interms of lower degree polynomial for $p(x) = x^3 - 5x^2 - 4x +20$
	- $p(x) = (x - a)q(x)$ => $p(x) = (x - 5)(x^2 - 4)$
	- alternatively => $p(x) = (x - 2)(x^2 - 3x - 10)$
	- the degree of $p(x)$ is `3` and the degree of $q(x)$ is `2`.
