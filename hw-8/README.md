# Polynomial practice

## Given $p(x) = x^3 - 5x^2 - 4x +20$

1. integer root
	- group factoring: 
	```
	$x^2(x - 5) + -4(x - 5)$
	$(x - 5)(x^2 - 4)$
	$(x - 5)(x - 2)(x + 2)$
	```
Thus integer roots are $(x - 5)$ and $(x - 2)$ = {2, 5}

2. write interms of lower degree polynomial
	- $p(x) = (x - a)q(x)$ => $p(x) = (x - 5)(x^2 - 4)$
	- degree of p(x) is 3 and degree of q(x) is 2.
