# Solution on Homework 4

## For `S = {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}`

- 4 + 4 = 8 mod 7 = 1
- 3 x 5 = 15 mod 7 = 1
- inverse of 3
* under addtion => 0, because `a . e = a`: for `3 + 0 = 3`
* under multiplication => 1, because `a . e = a`: for `3 x 1 = 3`

## For `S = {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}` is S and `+` a group?

Yes, because the operation satisfies all condition.

## What is -13 mod 5?

- 2

## What is the degree and positive root of the polynomial `x^3 - x^2 + 4x - 12`

- 3 degree
- `x^3 - x^2 + 4x - 12` = `(x - 2)(x^2 + x + 6)` = 2
